They can be found in urine, sputum, and other clinical specimens. They can sometimes be opportunistic pathogens particularly in immunocompromised patients in hospitals or in infants (Pepperell et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2002 Nov;46(11):3555-60. and references therein).\n\nThe strain of Citrobacter koseri being sequenced, strain CDC 4225-83, was isolated in 1983 in Maryland, where it caused neonatal meningitis. It was provided by Caroline Mohr and Melissa Campbell of CDC. The strain is available from the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC BAA-895 or from the Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre as SGSC4696. The genome was sequenced to 8X coverage, using plasmid and fosmid libraries and was finished to an error rate of less than 1 per 10,000 bases. Automated annotation was performed and manual annotation will continue in the labs of Michael McClelland and Kenneth Sanderson. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) has funded this project.\n\nCoding sequences below are predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2 v2.13.Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions generated based on protein alignments. RNA genes were determined usingtRNAscan-SE 1.23 or Rfam v8.0. This sequence was finished as follows unless otherwise noted: all regions were double stranded, sequenced with an alternate chemistries or covered by high quality data (i.e., phred quality \u003e=30); an attempt was made to resolve all sequencing problems, such as compressions and repeats; all regions were covered by sequence from more than one m13 subclone\nThe annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP).
